# Consumer-Reviews-And-Purchasing-Decisions

Consumer reviews are proven by most past literature to have an impact on product sales. This paper explores the impact of consumer reviews on product sales for video game products in particular, by using data extracted from Amazon and analyzing the relationship between review features and product Best Sellers Rank (BSR), an estimator of product sales. Several key findings emerged from analysis based on approximately 1.5 million reviews and 40,000 products. First, consumer reviews, especially ratings, have an impact on product sales: the higher the rating, the lower the product BSR, and the higher the number of sales. More recent ratings have a larger impact on older ratings. In addition, product features are also found to have an impact on product sales, although the effects are not as large as the ratings. The findings can help video game sellers improve their current business strategies to increase product sales.
